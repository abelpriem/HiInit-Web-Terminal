> HiInit is a `file and data upload web terminal` with the ability to register and log in users in different groups and categories.
> Files can be shared between different members of a specific group as well as navigate between the different folders that make up the root.
> There will be different roles with their corresponding permissions but only **ADMIN** user has the `CRUD System` (create, rewrite, update & delete).
